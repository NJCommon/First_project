        <h2>description</h2>
        <p>The Chevrolet Corvette (C8) is the eighth generation of the Corvette sports car manufactured by American automobile manufacturer Chevrolet. 
            It is the first rear mid-engine Corvette since the model's introduction in 1953, differing from the traditional front mid-engine design started in 1963. 
            The C8 was announced in April 2019, and the coupe made its official debut on July 18, 2019, in Tustin, California. 
            The convertible made its debut in October 2019 during a media event at the Kennedy Space Center to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission.
             Production officially began on February 3, 2020, delayed by the 2019 General Motors strike.</p>

            <p>The Corvette C8 is GM's first rear mid-engine sports car since the Pontiac Fiero.
                 It features a vastly different design from previous Corvettes, with an all-new aluminum architecture and coilover springs in place of the rear transverse mono-leaf spring used on prior models.
                  The exterior features more aggressive aerodynamics including larger air intakes and prominent side scoops. A trunk is located at the rear, with additional storage space at the front of the car.
                   Combined, these provide 13 cubic feet (370 L) of cargo space, 2 cubic feet (57 L) less than that of the C7. As a result of the switch to a mid-engine layout, the passenger cell has been shifted forward by 16.5 inches (420 mm).
                    The cockpit has been designed to be driver-centric, with numerous controls mounted on the center console as well as utilizing a new hexagonal steering wheel. 
                    A 12 in (30.5 cm) digital screen replaces the instrument cluster and reflects one of the six driving modes selected, and is accompanied by an 8 in (20.3 cm) touchscreen. 
                    A special Z button is located on the steering wheel; named in honor of earlier performance packages like Z51, Z06, and ZR1, it allows the driver to quickly activate customized performance settings</p>
