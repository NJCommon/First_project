        <h2>Races</h2>
        <p>C6 Corvettes have won numerous major races, most notably the 24 Hours of Le Mans (in the GT1 class) four times (2005, 2006, 2009, 2011).
             They have also secured multiple championships and wins in the American Le Mans Series (ALMS), FIA GT Championship, and other series, including the 12 Hours of Sebring
            Corvette Racing closed out its direct factory operation at the end of 2023, with General Motors solely focusing on customer teams with the new Chevrolet Corvette Z06 GT3.R.
             Beginning in 2024, the team rebranded under the name Corvette Racing by Pratt Miller Motorsports for the IMSA SportsCar Championship. Corvette Racing is also supporting TF Sport, which switched from Aston Martin to Corvette for 2024 in the FIA World Endurance Championship.
             Both the IMSA and WEC entries are run with limited GM factory support.</p>

            <p>Having already established the C5-R as a winning car, the development of the C6.R was more of an evolution of a design rather than an all new car which required long periods of testing and design.
                 Pratt Miller's process was aided by the fact that, unlike the C5-R which debuted several years after the C5 generation Corvette was on the streets, the C6.R and C6 generation Corvettes would be developed at the same time. 
                 This meant that design elements which would help the race car could be adapted to the road car, allowing the C6.R to use more exotic design features but still meet homologation requirements. 
                 In turn, this meant racing elements could be adapted to the Corvette Z06 performance car, which the C6.R shares it exterior styling with..</p>
