    <h2>Most Known Robins</h2>
    <p>Robin was created to give Batman a partner who brought hope and balance to his dark world.
Each Robin has their own personality, abilities, and background, making them unique crimefighters.
Together, they form a family built not by blood, but through shared pain and purpose.
Their presence reminds Batman that he doesn’t have to fight alone.
Each Robin learns from Batman but also helps him stay grounded and emotionally connected.
The mantle of Robin continues to evolve as new heroes step into the role.</p>
