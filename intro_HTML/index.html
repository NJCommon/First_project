    <h2>info about the blackbird</h2>
    <h3>current fastest manned plane in the world</h3>
    <p> a retired long range high altitute reconnaissance aircraft
        cappable of speeds up to Mach 3.2 and a hight of 85,000 feet made by the lockheed corporation in the 1960s.The speed of the new aircraft was to exceed 2,000 mph. Other planes of the era could, in theory, approximate that speed but only in short, after-burner-driven bursts. This new plane needed to maintain a record-setting speed for hours at a time. At such velocity, friction with the atmosphere generates temperatures that would melt the conventional airframe.
With anticipated temperatures on the aircraft’s leading edges exceeding 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, dealing with the heat raised a host of seemingly insurmountable design and material challenges. Titanium alloy was the only option for the airframe —providing the strength of stainless steel, a relatively light weight, and durability at the excessive temperatures.

<p>The SR-71 Blackbird resulted from a Cold War-era need for a high-speed, high-altitude strategic reconnaissance aircraft. 
    This aircraft cruised at more than three times the speed of sound, which translates to just over 2,000 miles per hour. 
    No other reconnaissance aircraft has operated in more hostile airspace or with such impunity. 
    To this day, the SR-71 holds the records for the world’s fastest jet-propelled aircraft and the fastest aircraft to be propelled by air-breathing engines.</p>
