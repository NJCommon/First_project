        <h2>breif description </h2>
        <p>The Chevrolet Corvette (C6) is the sixth generation of the Corvette sports car that was produced by Chevrolet from 2005 to 2013.
             It is the first Corvette with exposed headlamps (as opposed to hidden headlamps) since the 1962 model. 
             Production variants include the Z06, ZR1, Grand Sport, and 427 Convertible.
              Racing variants include the C6.R, an American Le Mans Series GT1 championship and 24 Hours of Le Mans GTE-Pro winner.
              Beginning with the 2008 model year, the Corvette received a new engine, the LS3.
               With displacement increased to 6,162 cc power was increased to 430 hp.</p>

            <p>The 2009 Corvette ZR1's used market price varies significantly, but averages around $75,100 to $102,784, depending on condition and mileage. 
                Prices can range from under $70,000 for examples with high mileage or accident history to over $100,000 for well-maintained, low-mileage models, with some recent sales exceeding $110,000. 
                The original MSRP was approximately $113,970 
                The Z06 and ZR1 look more taut and chiseled, thanks to wider front and rear fenders, more-aggressive front fascias, and a profusion of slats and scoops that channel cool air and exhaust heat.
                 The ZR1 adds sills, an air-dam extension, and a roof made of carbon fiber; a more prominent tail spoiler; somewhat tacky ZR1 badges; and a transparent panel in its carbon-fiber hood.</p>
