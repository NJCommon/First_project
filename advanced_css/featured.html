        <h2>MOST WANTED </h2>
<p>The 2005 Chevrolet Corvette C6.R is a grand tourer racing car built by Pratt & Miller as well as    
General Motors for competition in endurance racing.
Most of the street legal Corvette (C6) design remains in the C6.R as they were designed alongside each other. 
Most of the retained design resulted in the increased use of lightweight 
aluminium and a better designed airflow across the body.
The C6.R saw an innovation in design with the use of an air conditioning system that was better suited to keeping drivers cool at high cockpit temperatures..</p>

<p>At the time, even the standard Corvette C6 was well-liked by critics and the public.
Reviewers liked the car’s improved handling, stronger engine, and improved interior. 
Ride quality was noted as being impressively smooth and balanced. Critics praised the car for having improved on the previous Corvette C5 in nearly every way, from performance to refinement to comfort.
The Corvette C6 was regarded as a bargain, with one reviewer noting that anything within $20,000 of the Chevrolet would have a very hard time beating its performance.
The Porsche 911 at the time was several thousand dollars more than the Corvette and could not match its performance.
Today, the Corvette C6 is still regarded as a pre-owned sports car value. Prices for well-kept examples hover between the $30,000 and $40,000 marks, and the performance is comparable to many new cars costing thousands more. Early models are noted as being plagued with quality and mechanical issues, but later versions do not have those problems. Used car shoppers will find an easy time locating several great examples of the C6 on eBay and elsewhere. Even performance-modified versions like the Callaway Corvette are relatively easy to find.</p>
